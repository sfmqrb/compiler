# compiler project

## phase 1

### Scanner

A scanner is a program that takes a sequence of characters (the source file of the program) and produces a sequence of tokens that will be used to feed the compiler's parser.

## phase 2

### Parser

A parser is a compiler or interpreter component that breaks data into smaller elements for easy translation into another language. 

- parse tree

- panic mode

## phase 3

### Code generator

Generate intermediate code which is relatively close to assembly language

- handle recursive functions
